# Bamazon-App

## About Bamzon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront application that stores data using hardcore MySQL skills. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus, the app has been programmed to track product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of each departments gross sales in the store.

## How to Use ü§î

The user has 3 different javascript app file commands to choose from.

`node bamazonCustomer.js`

* Running this application first displays all of the items available for sale. Then the user is prompted with two messages:

    * What is the ID of the product they would like to purchase.
    * How many units of the product they would like to purchase.

`node bamazonManager.js`

* Running this application lists the following set of menu options for the user:

    * View Prodcuts for Sale
    * View Low Inventory
    * Add to Inventory
    * Add New Product

* The user is able to view products with an inventory of less than 5.
* The user is able to replenish the inventory of any chosen product.
* The user is able to add/remove any new or existing product to/from the store.

`node bamazonSupervisor.js`

* Running this application lists the following set of menu options for the user:

  * View Product Sales by Department
  * Create New Department
  * Remove Department

* The user is able to view total product sales and total profit for entire departments

* The user is able to add/remove any new or existing department to/from the store.

* This applications utilizes a seperate table in the database to store the *total sales* number for each department.

  * There's a hard coded *overhead-costs* number added to each department

  * A final column **Total Profit** is calculated on the fly by using the *overhead-costs* and the *total sales*

## How it Works üî® 

The user initializes the app by running the any of the 3 javascript files. 

The **NPM Package** `inquirer` is called when the logic of the application is ran. This *prompts* the user for input, which is then stored and further used for various functions throughout the app.

``` 
// Allow supervisor to create a brand new department in the database
function promptAdd() {

    inquirer.prompt([
        {
            type: "input",
            message: "Please enter the name of the department you would like to add?",
            name: "name",
        },
        {
            type: "input",
            message: "What are the overhead costs of this department?",
            name: "cost",
            filter: Number
        }
    ])
    .then(answers => {
        
        // Store user input as variables to pass as arguments
        let depName = answers.name;
        let depCost = answers.cost;

        // Pass department data thru addDepartment
        addDepartment(depName, depCost);
    });
}

function addDepartment(name, cost) {

    // Update database
    let query = "INSERT INTO departments SET ? ";

    connection.query(query, 
        [
            {
                department_name: name,
                over_head_costs: cost,
            }
        ],
    function(err, res) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log("\n\n                        $ $ $ $ ".green + " Bamazon Supervisor | ".white + colors.yellow(name) +" Department Added ".white +  " $ $ $ $\n\n".green);
        supervisorPrompt();
    });
}
```
